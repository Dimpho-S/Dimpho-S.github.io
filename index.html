        <p class ="about-desc"> Hi and welcome! I am currently unroute to completing my Electical and Computer Engineering undergrad degree at the University of Cape Town.</p>
<p class ="about-desc">I first fell in love with the flexibility of the field — one day I could be exploring ideas that touch on aerospace, another day I could be looking into biomedical technology, or even diving into networking and automation. It feels less like a straight path and more like a gateway into a plethora of exciting projects. </p>
<p class ="about-desc">Over the years, my experiences and challenges have shaped this perspective, which has been the driving force in unlocking a strong passion for app development and embedded systems.</p>
 <p class ="about-desc">This site is just a small window into that journey, and if you enjoy it, please feel free to <a href="#contact" class="link-btn"><span>contact me</span></a>. </p>

            <p>Bird weight readings with timestamps are recorded by each node in an ESP32-based network and stored in SPIFFS.  ESP-NOW is used by nodes to communicate, sending JSON messages with hop-path tracking and TTL throughout the mesh.</p>
            <p>Through the use of Bluetooth, a gateway ESP32 connects the mesh to a mobile application, enabling the application to request CSV logs, verify secure downloads, or initiate remote deletions.  With mesh relaying enabling coverage outside of direct BLE range, the system guarantees that data is both locally logged and remotely retrievable.

            <p>
  The A.M.O.A.N app was built to work hand-in-hand with a ESP32 network designed for monitoring bird weights. Using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), the app connects to a gateway node that gathers timestamped weight data stored across the network. This makes it possible to retrieve, view, and manage data seamlessly from a phone without needing direct access to every device in the system.
</p>
<p>
  The app allows users to download CSV files of recorded measurements, confirm safe receipt, and even trigger remote file deletion on the ESP32 nodes when storage needs to be managed.

  <p>
  A business plan for the Uninterrupted Warnings and Guidance System (UWAGS), an app concept that acts as an automatic panic button for individuals experiencing a panic attack. The idea was to integrate the app with a smartwatch, enabling it to detect critical signals and instantly notify the user’s doctor. This approach aimed to provide immediate medical attention, especially in situations where the user might be alone and unable to call for help.
</p>

<p>
  The concept was entered into the <em>Modiragatsi</em> competition, run by the NWU Business School, where it was selected as one of the finalists. Developing UWGS into a structured business plan gave me the opportunity to combine technical creativity with entrepreneurial thinking, while showcasing how technology can play a vital role in improving health and safety.
